Description: Disertation Topic for Masters Degree. 
Detailed in this thesis is an exaughsive synthesis of three of the most popular biologically inspired optimization algotihms (the Ant Conoly, Particle Swarm, and Genetic Optimization Algorithms), including thier the most polular variants to their methodologies, and a comparative statistical analysis performed to isolate optimum configurations for each of optimization strategy. Finaly, hybrids models were build from the tuned base models for a final statistical comparison (along with a benchmark greedy optimizer) to complete the research objectives:
1. Demonstrate that a hybrid algorithm will outperform the best base algorithm.
2. Demonstrate that choice of hybridiztion strategy is important through a low performing hybrid algorithm despite a standardized hybridization strategy.

Parameters:
The optimization challenge chosen in this project to measure performance was the Traveling Salesman Combinatoral Optimization Problem. 100 maps, each using a 500x500 coordinate system, for each problem size (10,20,30,40,50 cities) were generated and used accross all algorithms. For all algorithms used, the set population size was 50 and the set number itterations per run was 100.
