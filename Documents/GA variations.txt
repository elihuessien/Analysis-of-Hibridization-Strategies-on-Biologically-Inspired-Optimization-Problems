GA breeding variations

---Selecting pool
1) Stochastic Sampling with replacement - like a roulette wheel where each individual is represented by a space that coressponds to it's fitness. By repeatedly spinning the wheel, individulas are chosen to fill the intermediate breeding population.

2) Remainder Stochastic Sampling - again Roulette wheel but this time, evenly spaced pointers.




---breeding
radomly chose a mutation point and the two individuals swap genes occuring after that point, producing the next two individuals.


--mutation
each gene in the child has a random probability of mutation/swap (unsually less that 1%).
