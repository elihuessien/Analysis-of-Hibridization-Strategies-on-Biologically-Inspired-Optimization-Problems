Dissertation Plan


- 6 algorithms (3 base, 3 hybrid)

- Hybrid mixed based on 3 of the 4 styles shown in the     hybridization strategies paper(HSP) to demonstrate.

- 20 particles/generations each like HSP

- Experiment repeted on the entire dataset 5 times each.

- To collect as unbiased and representative a dataset as   possible (again like HSP)

- Compile Averages just to see (average over 5 runs,   average overall)
